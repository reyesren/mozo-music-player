# Mozo Music Player

`Mohammed Osumah & Renzo Reyes`

## Description

The Mozo music player is a multi-feature all in one type of music player where users can create their own accounts and upload new songs to their music library. Some of the features incorporated are uploading music audio files into a user's account, Adding music from youtube url to user's account, being able to download their music from their library to their local storage, creating public and private playlists, playing their music on the application and shuffling through their music. Users can also search for different public playlists by other users. The application will also give users the ability to add playlists to their favourites so that they can refer to it whenever they need to. User's will have the ability to share their playlists on different social media platforms. We will also include a feature where the users can see the equalizer frequency on the music while the music is playing. We will also have a data limit for each user.

### Beta Version

We hope to have most of the application done by the beta. Some key features we are looking to have done by the beta are uploading music audio files into a user's account, converting from a url to multiple audio file formats, being able to download their music from their library to their local storage, creating public and private playlists, playing their music on the application and shuffling through their music.

### Final Version

For the final version, we hope to have a fully functional web application that we can post to the web. All the additional features that we hope to have done by the final are being able to search for different public playlists, being able to add a playlist to your favourite, being able to share your playlists on different social media platforms and the equalizer frequency when playing music.

### Technical challenges

1. **Learning Ruby on Rails**: We don't have any experience on the language and the framework, so there will be a steep learning curve.

2. **Designing the database**: We need to figure out what schemas we will be using and how to structure them.

3. **Planning all our routes and endpoints**: We need to figure out what end points we need and how we're going to be routing.

4. **Deciding on APIs**: We will need to figure out whether there are other APIs we can use for some of the more difficult features.

5. **Sharing playlists on social media**: We are unsure how we're going to do this feature at the moment, but we will do research.
